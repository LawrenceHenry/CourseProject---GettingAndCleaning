CourseProject---GettingAndCleaning
==================================

Holds the Course Project for The Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course

This repository holds the script (run_analysis.R) that builds the tidy_data file that corresponds to the CookBook.md which describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.

You will need the raw data files located at this location to make this all work.

Once loaded and unzipped, you can run the run_analysis.R script from within R Studio... make sure your working directory is on level above the UCI HAR Dataset directory... since the script assumes it is working from there... (hint: use the getwd() and setwd() commands in the R Studio console.)
